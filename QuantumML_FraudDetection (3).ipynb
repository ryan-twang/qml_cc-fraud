        "As financial institutions face rising threats from increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, there is a growing demand for advanced technologies that can enhance detection accuracy while operating efficiently under real-world constraints. Our project aligns with this strategic imperative by exploring QML for fraud detection—a domain that combines the computational strengths of quantum systems with the predictive power of modern machine learning. Building on recent research into quantum-enhanced anomaly detection, we apply Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) to evaluate their practical viability on structured financial transaction data. By comparing these quantum models against classical counterparts using robust metrics such as recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC, we provide insight into QML’s potential to uncover fraud patterns. Even if the field is ultimately unproven, we still wish to highlight a new technology we find interesting and provide visualizations as to how it works."

        "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) combines principles of quantum computing with machine learning algorithms. While often defined as using \"quantum algorithms\" for learning tasks, the practical meaning remains more nuanced. In essence, QML leverages qubits, which—unlike classical bits—can exist in superpositions of 0 and 1. Each qubit is defined by two complex amplitudes, allowing quantum circuits to represent more complex transformations than classical systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our project, we apply QML to the problem of fraud detection using supervised classification. Specifically, we implement a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), which combines a quantum feature map for data encoding with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) that is trained to separate classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "To prepare the dataset, we first balance it by undersampling the majority class (non-fraud cases) to match the number of fraud cases. We then scale the features to the [0, 1] range using MinMax normalization, and pad the feature vectors to the nearest power of two. This padding is required for amplitude encoding using Qiskit’s RawFeatureVector, which directly embeds classical vectors as the amplitudes of a quantum state in a\n",

        "\n",
        "Although previous work such as Han et al. (2024) critiques traditional one-to-one angle encoding for limited expressivity, we take a different approach by using amplitude-based embedding. This allows for compact, expressive representations suitable for small- to mid-scale quantum simulators. We pair this with a trainable PQC (RealAmplitudes) and optimize it using COBYLA, tracking performance using classification metrics such as F1-score and ROC AUC.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, this approach helps us evaluate the potential of quantum-enhanced classification pipelines under realistic constraints. While more advanced designs like MEDQ explore multi-qubit embeddings per feature, our implementation provides a meaningful benchmark for near-term QML capabilities on structured datasets."

        "1. Each data point in our feature space ℝ^32 is mapped to a quantum state using a feature map function φ. This quantum feature map encodes classical features (e.g., as rotation angles or phase shifts) into the parameters of a quantum circuit. Each feature is assigned to a unique qubit, so with 32 features, we use 5 qubits. These qubits collectively define a quantum state in a Hilbert space of dimension ℂ^32 (i.e., ℂ^(2^5)).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. A Hilbert space is a complete inner product space over the complex numbers ℂ. This structure allows us to define angles and distances between quantum states, which is essential for classification. The inner product ⟨x|x′⟩ between two quantum states defines a similarity measure (used in quantum kernels), and the fact that the space is \"complete\" ensures that all converging sequences (i.e., Cauchy sequences) have a limit within the space. This mathematical foundation is what enables quantum models to operate in high-dimensional spaces efficiently, potentially uncovering patterns that are not linearly separable in the original feature space."
